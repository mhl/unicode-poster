These scripts require the following binaries:

   ruby (package ruby1.8)
   curl (package curl)
   gs   (package ghostscript)
   make (package make)
   gocr (package gocr)

... and you will need the following libraries installed:

   libpng12-dev

For composing the poster strips you will need netpbm of at least
version 10.34.  (I don't think the Debian-free version works
for this, but I haven't checked in a while.  More on this below.)

Step 1: Extracting the Glyphs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You should be able to run:

   ./make-unicode-poster

After a long time (at least a day on my computer) this will generate
some useful output in the directory individual-characters/non-blank/
These files include:

  U????-???-????????.png

    The glyph images with Unicode codepoint

  U????-???-????????-top.png

    Just the glyph image, cropped from the image above

  U????-???-????????-bottom.png

    Just the image of the Unicode codepoint, also cropped from the
    full glyph image.

  sizes.yaml

    Information about the size of the image files and the block
    that the characters are from.

  codepoints.yaml

    Gives the name of each image glyph and the Unicode codepoint
    acquired from doing OCR on the
